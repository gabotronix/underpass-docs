# SoftEther VPN

### Initial Configuration

Please refer to [this article](https://vp-next.com/en/vpn-server-manager/) so that you can configure SoftEther remotely from the SoftEther VPN Server Manager for Windows.

Use `5555` when asked for the `Port Number` (TCP Port) to use in SoftEther VPN Server Manager.

You can also check the Server Manager [official documentation](https://www.softether.org/4-docs/1-manual/2._SoftEther_VPN_Essential_Architecture/2.4_VPN_Server_Manager).
